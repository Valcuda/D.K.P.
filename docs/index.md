# Ensueños
## The Size Bending Adventure

### About
Ensueños (Codenamed "DKP") is a student project for the Skills USA competition in Maine.
It's a 3rd person, adventure horror game, with some puzzle elements.

The game takes place in a hospital, which the player is trying to escape. A core gameplay mechanic is that the player will, occasionally, shrink in size, forcing them to explore familiar environments, _from a whole_ **_new_** _perspective._

"I've personally been interested in game development my whole life. Honestly, working on a team, even of just 3 people, is a dream come true! I've personally taught myself quite a bit about game development, and the tools surrounding it, so it's only natural I'd become the project manager XD. It honestly really is fun tho, watching as the game takes shape. I'd say this is the funnest, and coolest thing **EVER** in my life so far, I wouldn't trade it for anything." - Dakota Willey
